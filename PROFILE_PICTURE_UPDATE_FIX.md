# Profile Picture Update Fix

## Problem
After deployment, profile picture updates were failing with a 500 Internal Server Error. The server logs showed:
```
ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'manga.jpg'
```

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `updateProfile` function in `userController.js` and `addDoctor` function in `adminController.js`. The code was incorrectly trying to upload `imageFile.originalname` (just the filename) to Cloudinary instead of the actual file data.

Since the application uses `multer.memoryStorage()`, uploaded files are stored in memory as buffers, not saved to disk. The `originalname` property only contains the filename, not the file content.

## Solution
Fixed the Cloudinary upload code to properly handle memory-stored files by:

1. **Converting buffer to base64**: Converting the file buffer to base64 format that Cloudinary can accept
2. **Creating data URI**: Building a proper data URI with mimetype and base64 data
3. **Adding error handling**: Proper validation and error handling for file uploads
4. **Image optimization**: Added transformations to optimize uploaded images

### Before (Incorrect):
```javascript
const imageUpload = await cloudinary.uploader.upload(imageFile.originalname, {
    resource_type: "image"
})
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
// Convert buffer to base64 data URL for cloudinary upload
const b64 = Buffer.from(imageFile.buffer).toString("base64");
const dataURI = "data:" + imageFile.mimetype + ";base64," + b64;

const imageUpload = await cloudinary.uploader.upload(dataURI, {
    resource_type: "image",
    folder: "user_profiles",
    transformation: [
        { width: 500, height: 500, crop: "limit" },
        { quality: "auto" }
    ]
});
```

## Files Modified
1. `backend/controllers/userController.js` - Fixed `updateProfile` function
2. `backend/controllers/adminController.js` - Fixed `addDoctor` function

## Additional Improvements
1. **File validation**: Added size and type validation
2. **Error handling**: Proper error messages for upload failures
3. **Image optimization**: Automatic resizing and quality optimization
4. **Folder organization**: Images are now organized in folders on Cloudinary

## Testing
After deploying these changes:
1. Profile picture updates should work correctly
2. New images should appear immediately after upload
3. Error messages should be more descriptive if upload fails

## Notes
- The `doctorController.js` was already correctly implemented
- All image uploads now use consistent buffer-to-base64 conversion
- Cloudinary folders help organize uploads by type (user_profiles, doctor_profiles)
